- The src directory contains all the code that was witten.
- The Pred_Files directory contains all the .pred files that were generated during the experiments.


For execution ----- 

First change your directory to the decision-trees directory

1. In order to execute 2.b (SGD) execute ./testSGD.sh

	This will compile and execute the SGD implementation of the problem set

2. In order to execute 2.c and 2.d, execute ./testId3.sh

	This has three execution calls to the Id3() program.
	The first execution is for the Id3() with max_depth = -1 and creates a 2.c.pred file
	The second execution is for the Id3() with max_depth = 4 and creates a 2.d.4.pred file
	The third execution is for the Id3() with max_depth = 8 and creates a 2.d.8.pred file

3. In order to execute 2.e, execute ./testDecisionStumps.sh

	This will compile and execute the Decision Stumps implementation of the problem set.
